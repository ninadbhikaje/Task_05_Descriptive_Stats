# Task_05_Descriptive_Stats

Project Overview

This project explores and visualizes the 2024 Syracuse University Men's Lacrosse season using data extracted from official team statistics. The analysis is designed to simulate the process of using a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to understand and respond to natural language questions about a structured dataset — mimicking how a coach, analyst, or sports journalist might interact with performance data to extract insights.

The dataset includes detailed player statistics, team performance metrics, game results, and period-by-period breakdowns. To assess the utility of LLMs in real-world sports analytics, the project combines manual prompt engineering, LLM reasoning, and Python visualizations to answer both simple and complex natural language questions.

Example questions tackled include:

“How many games did Syracuse play?”

“Who was the leading scorer?”

“Should the team focus on offense or defense to win more games next year?”

“Which player has the most breakout potential and why?”

The analysis includes:

1. Visual summaries (bar charts, pie charts, grouped comparisons)

2. Prompt engineering experiments with ChatGPT to evaluate reasoning

3. Jupyter Notebook for replicable, Python-based exploration

By combining data science and language model reasoning, this project showcases the strengths and limitations of AI-assisted sports analytics, with a focus on generating actionable insights through transparent and explainable methods.
